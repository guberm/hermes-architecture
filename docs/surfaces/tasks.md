# Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs

Public-safe low-level inventory of Hermes scheduled automation. Private/client-sensitive names are grouped, but schedules, execution modes, scripts, and workdirs are retained when safe.

## Execution model

- **no-agent script jobs**: scheduler executes a script and delivers stdout verbatim; empty stdout means silent success.
- **agent-backed jobs**: scheduler injects context/script output into Hermes and lets the agent reason before delivering a response.
- **private delivery targets** are intentionally collapsed to `configured private channel`.
